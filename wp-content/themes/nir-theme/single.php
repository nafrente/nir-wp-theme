                <h2>The Newport Integrated Resiliency Model</h2>
                <p>Newport’s model of integrated resiliency is a response to
                    challenges, and synergy of opportunities among the built/
                    natural environment, economics, social/political, educational,
                    health and cultural sub-systems. The Newport Model is
                    systematic, and uniquely defines integrated resilience in three
                    stages:

                        locales by utilizing new technologies, materials, designs
                        and processes for both local economy AND by the export of
